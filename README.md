# TorZillaPrint

TorZillaPrint aims to provide a comprehensive, all-in-one, fingerprinting test bed, nicely broken into suitable sections with relevant information together. We're into regression tests, Proof of Concepts, the lot. Ideally, we'd also like to provide the means to export or submit results, and the ability to upload/paste results for comparisons.

The test page is right [here](https://ghacksuserjs.github.io/TorZillaPrint/TorZillaPrint.html) ... it's early days. If a result is blank, then we haven't coded for it yet.


### :heart: What we do care about:
- Current Tor Browser and Firefox ESR or higher
- Tor Uplift, FuzzyFox, Fusion
- Comparing Tor Browser with Firefox
- First party only (for now)
- Lowering entropy
- Help. We'll take all the help we can get.
- Kittens. We love kittens.

### :question: What we might care about:
- Looks and speed (but we are professionals)
- Collecting data via submissions
- Expanding to include tests that require third parties
- Additional test pages for specific things

### :hankey: What we don't care about:
- Other browsers
- Flash
- Extensions (except those used in Tor Browser if they affect tests)
- Providing entropy figures

### :kiss: Acknowledgments

You know who you are. We don't need to list everyone. You're doing this to make the world a better place - that's your reward. And that's about it, for now. If you want to contribute with your amazing skills - come in and say hello.
